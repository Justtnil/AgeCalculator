## ‚ú® Features

This app is more than just a simple age calculator. It's packed with features to handle various date and age-related queries.

* **Clean, Modern UI:** Built with Material 3 design principles for a beautiful and intuitive user experience.
* **Dynamic Theming:** Automatically adapts its color scheme to the user's wallpaper on Android 12+ (Material You).
* **Adaptive Layout:** The UI gracefully adjusts to fit different screen sizes, from standard phones to large tablets.
* **Smooth Animations:** All results and screen transitions are animated for a polished, fluid feel.
* **User-Friendly Input:** An auto-formatting text field allows users to input dates as a continuous string of numbers (`ddmmyyyy`), which are displayed with slashes for readability.
* **Multiple Calculation Modes:**
    * üìÖ **Age from Today:** The classic age calculator based on the current date.
    * üóìÔ∏è **Age at a Specific Date:** Find out how old someone was on a particular historical date.
    * üéÇ **Date from a Specific Age:** Calculate the exact future date when someone will reach a certain age (e.g., when they will be 50 years, 5 months, and 5 days old).
* **Robust Error Handling:** Provides clear, user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., future dates, incorrect formats).
* **Back Gesture Support:** Proper navigation handling ensures the back gesture works as expected, returning to the home screen instead of closing the app.
